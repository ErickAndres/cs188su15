However, one cool theorem is that consistent heuristics imply admissibility (notice the single if, this is not true the other way around)


kfor uniform cost search, expand out with paths with lowest cost.
for breadth first search expand with shortest path.
depth first search goes for longest path
greedy use heuristic

Euclidean distance will always be less than Manhattan distance, so it is admissable.
heuristics are used to estimate the true cost to the goal


For regular A∗ graph search, If h is consistent, then A∗ graph search finds an optimal solution.Consistency ensures that the first time we expand a state, the cost to that state is optimal. This is important for A* graph search, because the first time a state is expanded, it will go in the closed set, and it will NEVER be expanded again.

in graph search algorithm node goes in fringe 
state goes to empty set
usually easier to apply uniry constraints prior to anything to gsp
The fringe is a general term for that data structure holding the upcoming nodes.

Unary constraints are constraints that involve a single variable. i only contrains (B), v only constrains (A), and vi only constrains (D). All the other constraints involve more than one variable.

How many constraints does the CSP have? it is 5 since they are 5 squares that represent constraints

quiz 4 answer second third one is asking which nodes actually got expanded. Others aren’t
.

ask about hw3 about shallow search???

Sherlock Agent->really good knowledge base
-evidence, understanding of how the world works(physics, chem, sociology)
-> really good inference
-skills of deduction

entailment a entails B, so a is a subset of B.
Entailment relates two sentences, while an implication is itself a sentence


for last question from quiz 5 of lecture 7 of spring 2015 you get answer based on just relating the facts



DONT understand last question of LECTURE 7
